## Topics to cover/outline

* Visualization intro (~1 min)
  * 2D viz and 3D viz are similar in many respects
    - What does data-driven mean?
      - value from attribute, expression, function
    - Handled with the same renderers
    - Principles of color, generalization, etc.
    - Just because you can, doesn't mean you should :)
* What can you do? (~10 min)
  * Demo heavy
  * Extrusions, paths, complex object symbols
    - SDK sample with extrusions (thematic/real world)
  * Visualize thematic data in the real world (types)
    - colorMixMode with buildings.
    - icons as thematic visualization with buildings
  * Data exploration in 3D (smart mapping)
    - Slider with cylinders
    - Geoenriched buildings
  * Create abstract 3D visualizations
    - exaggerated elevation
    - thematic elevation

* How do you do it? (~10 min.)
  * Dive into code
  * Brief overview of
    - renderers
    - symbols and symbol layers
  * API reference
  * Samples
  * Extend WebGL engine

* What's new with 3D in the API? (~5 min)
  * More demos
    - Callout
    - Icon perspective
    - Highlight!
  * More code (in snippets)

* What are some best practices? Things to keep in mind... (~5 min)
  * SceneViewer
  * Caveats
* Check out available resources (~1 min)
  * SDK (samples, API reference, test data)
  * Blogs
  * GeoNet
  * Meet us at the showcase (until Thursday at 1:30 p.m.)
