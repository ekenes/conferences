## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: 2D Visualization](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2021/2d-viz/)

The ArcGIS API for JavaScript lets you build powerful interactive mapping applications. Learn the basics of how you can turn your raw data into information that tells a story with 2D data-driven visualizations. This session will provide an overview to the various visualization techniques available in the API specific to 2D vector data. You will also learn tips and tricks to help you feel more confident in making smart choices for visualizing your data.

## [Best Practices for Building Web Apps that Visualize Large Datasets](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2021/large-data/)

Learn about the various technologies used behind the scenes by ArcGIS Online and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript that help you work with more features in the browser. Weâ€™ll demonstrate step-by-step how to optimize a large dataset for rendering and analysis in the browser starting with data preparation, feature service settings, and visualization techniques in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript that will allow your users to work with more data more efficiently in your web apps. We hope to have you walk away inspired with innovative ways to do the same in your apps.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Using Arcade with Your Apps](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2021/arcade/)

This session will demonstrate how you can transform your data from one or more field values to computed data values for use in data visualizations, popup content, and labels. This session will start by providing a beginner's overview to the Arcade language. Then we'll show how you can use Arcade in advanced workflows to create immersive web apps for data exploration. We'll also demonstrate some tips and tricks for debugging Arcade expressions and point out how you can avoid common pitfalls. The session will close with a peek into the latest features introduced in Arcade and provide some hints of what you can expect in the future.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Clustering](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2021/clustering/)

In this session, we'll demonstrate how you can leverage clustering to effectively explore and summarize your data while reducing visual clutter.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Data-driven animations](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2021/data-driven-animations/)

Learn how to create revealing multi-dimensional animations of your data, including: animated data filters, animating data variables, and animating visual variables.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Dynamic vector symbology](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2021/dynamic-vector-symbols/)

Learn the basics of working with scalable vector symbols (CIM symbols), from creating your own symbols from scratch to publishing symbols for easy use in your apps. We'll also demonstrate how you can leverage these multi-part symbols to create dynamic data-driven visualizations.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Case studies of immersive apps for exploring data](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2021/immersive-case-studies/)

We'll explore three apps that visualize various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in an immersive and interactive user experience. 1. Capacity Analysis - This app visualizes how COVID-19 interventions, such as social distancing, impact hospital bed, ICU bed, and ventilator capacity. 2. Viral - This app allows you to explore multiple variables depicting the spread of COVID-19 in the United States by county in an animated time-series visualization. 3. CovidPulse - This app visualizes the active COVID cases in each U.S. state and county with spark lines, showing the overall trend of COVID-19 in one glance.
