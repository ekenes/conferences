# ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Case studies of immersive apps for exploring data

length: 60 min

presenters: Kristian Ekenes, Jeremy Bartley

March --, 2021 --:-- am - --:-- am PST

## Summary

We'll explore three apps that visualize various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in an immersive and interactive user experience. 1. Capacity Analysis - This app visualizes how COVID-19 interventions, such as social distancing, impact hospital bed, ICU bed, and ventilator capacity. 2. Viral - This app allows you to explore multiple variables depicting the spread of COVID-19 in the United States by county in an animated time-series visualization. 3. CovidPulse - This app visualizes the active COVID cases in each U.S. state and county with spark lines, showing the overall trend of COVID-19 in one glance.

## Demos

### Viral

#### Explore COVID-19 data in the United States

The [following app](https://ekenes.github.io/covid19viz/) demonstrates how you can visualize COVID-19 data in a variety of ways using the same dataset. Use the time slider to explore this data through time. Each time the slider moves, the layer's renderer and popups update based on newly generated [Arcade expressions](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/).
