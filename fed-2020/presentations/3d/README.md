# Practical Guide to Building 3D Web Apps

length: 60 min

presenters: Kristian Ekenes, Russell Roberts

Feb. 12, 2020 5:15 p.m. - 6:15 p.m.

Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Room 102 B

## Summary

Discover the 3D capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and learn how to leverage them to build stunning 3D web applications. This session will focus on the fundamental 3D building blocks of the API: SceneView, 2D and 3D layers, terrain, and symbology.

## Outline

I. Introduction to 3D
  A. Examples
  B. 3D Platform
  C. Create a basic 3D app (from 2D to 3D)
II. Web Scenes
III. Build web app with web scene

##### [3D buildings](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-apps-guide/demos/3d-buildings/)

This app demonstrates how to load a web scene with the ArcGIS Portal API and modify its properties. You can leverage the slides API to apply layers, basemaps, and view properties to the view instance referencing the scene. You can also manipulate the filter and visualization of operational layers.
