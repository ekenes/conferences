Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Room 102 B

### Summary

Discover the 3D capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and learn how to leverage them to build stunning 3D web applications. This session will focus on the fundamental 3D building blocks of the API: SceneView, 2D and 3D layers, terrain, and symbology.

### Demos

##### [3D buildings](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-apps-guide/demos/3d-buildings/)

This app demonstrates how to load a web scene with the ArcGIS Portal API and modify its properties. You can leverage the slides API to apply layers, basemaps, and view properties to the view instance referencing the scene. You can also manipulate the filter and visualization of operational layers.

##### [Basic scene](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-apps-guide/demos/basics/)

This sample demonstrates how to construct a simple 3D app using the SceneView.
