## [Visualization with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/fed-2020/presentations/viz/README.md)

The ArcGIS API for JavaScript provides APIs that allow you to build powerful interactive mapping applications. Learn how you can turn your raw data into information that tells a story with 2D and 3D data-driven visualizations. This session will provide an overview to the various visualization techniques available in the ArcGIS JS API.

## [Practical Guide to Building 3D Web Apps](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/fed-2020/presentations/3d/README.md)

Discover the 3D capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and learn how to leverage them to build stunning 3D web applications. This session will focus on the fundamental 3D building blocks of the API: SceneView, 2D and 3D layers, terrain, and symbology.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Using Arcade with your Apps](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/fed-2020/presentations/arcade/README.md)

Sometimes simple calculations can provide more insight than field values when creating data-driven visualizations. Arcade is a scripting language that allows you to drive visualizations, popup content, and labels by a value returned from an expression rather than a field value. This session will provide an overview of how to navigate the Arcade documentation while highlighting some of the key functions available in Arcade and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. View examples of how powerful Arcade can be when creating visualizations and labels for a FeatureLayer. Also, observe how the live Arcade editor in ArcGIS Online can be a powerful tool in helping you write, edit, debug, and execute custom expressions.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Programming Patterns and API Fundamentals with version 4.x](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/fed-2020/presentations/fundamentals/README.md)

In this session, you'll learn the basics of the ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript, including the fundamentals of watching for property changes, autocasting, working with collections, and lazy-loading data in your applications. You'll learn more details about maps, web maps, layers, 2D and 3D views, UI, and widgets. This is a key session for developers new to the 4.x version of the API.
