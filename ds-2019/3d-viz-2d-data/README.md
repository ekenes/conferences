### Summary

Have you hesitated to build 3D apps because they look complicated or you lack the necessary data? In this session, learn how to build a 3D app using your 2D data and the resources provided out of the box by Esri and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Even if your data doesn't contain Z-values, you can build sophisticated 3D apps that leverage modern browser technology to render your 2D features with 3D symbology.
