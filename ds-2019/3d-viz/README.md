### Summary

The ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript provides a set of APIs allowing you to build powerful interactive 3D mapping applications. In this session, we'll focus on the visualization capabilities specific to 3D views. We'll dive into the various symbol types and visual variables and demonstrate how they interact with renderers. You'll learn cartographic techniques unique to 3D and see several demos showing how to thematically visualize 2D features with 3D symbols. We'll also provide an overview of how to visualize data in layers specific to 3D views.

### Demos

#####  [Buildings with Visual Variables and Edges](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2018/3d-viz/demos/thematic-edges/)

San Francisco buildings visualized with a color visual variable showing walk times. Edges can be toggled on and off of the buildings.


#####  [Smart Mapping: Building scene layer](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2018/3d-viz/demos/thematic-edges/)

San Francisco buildings visualized with a color visual variable showing walk times. The renderer is generated using smart mapping. The color slider allows users to explore the visual aspect of the data.

##### [Point Styles for cities](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/visualization-point-styles/index.html)

App that demonstrates how to visualize points of interest in a city scene.
