## Dot Density - U.S. Population by Race

This app visualizes U.S. population by Census Tract using Dot Density. Each dot represents 800 people at the initial scale of the map. As you zoom, the dot value dynamically updates to maintain the same visual density across scale. Color is used to map population of different races. Move the cursor over the legend to emphasize the population distribution of one race at a time.
