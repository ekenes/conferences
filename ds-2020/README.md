# 2019 Dev Summit notes, slides, and demos

Navigate to the appropriate directory to view notes for the corresponding session described below.

## 2D Visualization with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

The ArcGIS API for JavaScript lets you build powerful interactive mapping applications. Learn how you can turn your raw data into information that tells a story with simple 2D data-driven visualizations. This session will provide an overview to the various visualization techniques available in the API specific to 2D vector data.

## 3D Visualization with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

The ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript provides a set of APIs allowing you to build powerful interactive 3D mapping applications. In this session, we'll focus on the visualization capabilities specific to 3D views. We'll dive into the various symbol types and visual variables and demonstrate how they interact with renderers. You'll learn cartographic techniques unique to 3D and see several demos showing how to thematically visualize 2D features with 3D symbols. We'll also provide an overview of how to visualize data in layers specific to 3D views.

## ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Using Arcade with Your Apps

Sometimes simple calculations can provide more insight than field values when creating data-driven 
visualizations. Arcade is a scripting language that allows you to drive visualizations, popup content, 
and labels by a value returned from an expression rather than a field value. This session will provide 
an overview of how to navigate the Arcade documentation while highlighting some of the key functions 
available in Arcade and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. View examples of how powerful Arcade can be when 
creating visualizations and labels for a FeatureLayer. Also, observe how the live Arcade editor in ArcGIS
Online can be a powerful tool in helping you write, edit, debug, and execute custom expressions.

## Practical Guide for Building a 3D Web App From 2D Data

Have you hesitated to build 3D apps because they look complicated or you lack the necessary data? 
In this session, learn how to build a 3D app using your 2D data and the resources provided out of 
the box by Esri and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Even if your data doesn't contain Z-values, you 
can build sophisticated 3D apps that leverage modern browser technology to render your 2D features 
with 3D symbology.
