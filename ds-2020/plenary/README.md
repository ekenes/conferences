# 2020 Dev Summit Plenary Demos

## Ocean temperature and salinity

[This app](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2020/plenary/emu/index.html) loads a subset of Esri's open [Ecological Marine Unit](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/science/ecological-marine-units/overview) data as points, and renders them in the [Spilhaus projection](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/756bcae18d304a1eac140f19f4d5cb3d).

Once the data loads, you can explore how temperature or salinity varies throughout the oceans by x,y coordinates and by depth. Hover over a point to see how salinity or temperature varies by depth for a specific location.

Switch on "Show currents" to see how the velocity and direction of ocean currents varies across depth throughout the world.

You can also filter data within a distance of a line and summarize it in a histogram with the "Filter along a path" button in the "Filter tools" tab.
