##### [Continuous size: Worldwide earthquakes](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2017/2d-viz/samples/earthquakes/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a continuous size visualization on a point layer to visualize worldwide earthquakes by magnitude.

##### [Continuous color: Mexico education](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2017/2d-viz/samples/mexico-education/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a continuous color visualization by shading fill symbols based on a numeric attribute. This app visualizes the percentage of adults in Mexico that did not participate in any formal education.

##### [Predominance with Arcade: Educational attainment in Mexico](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2017/2d-viz/samples/mexico-education-predominance/)

This sample uses an Arcade expression to visualize the predominant educational attainment acheived in each municipality of Mexico. An opacity visual variable is applied to show the strength of predominance.

##### [Multivariate visualization: 2012 U.S. presidential election](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2017/2d-viz/samples/multivariate-election/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a multivariate visualization using several variables related to the 2012 U.S. presidential election. The color indicates the winner (or predominant vote-getter). Opacity indicates the strength of the win. Size indicates the total number of votes cast in the county.

##### [Smart mapping for data exploration](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2017/2d-viz/samples/smart-mapping/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a data exploration app using the Smart Mapping APIs. You can use the slider widgets to modify the visualization based on variables related to the 2012 election.
