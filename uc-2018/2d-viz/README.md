##### [Continuous size: Worldwide earthquakes](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2018/2d-viz/samples/1-earthquakes/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a continuous size visualization on a point layer to visualize worldwide earthquakes by magnitude.

##### [Continuous color: Boise Housing](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2018/2d-viz/samples/1-visual-variables/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a continuous color visualization by shading fill symbols based on a numeric attribute. This app visualizes housing statistics in the Boise, Idaho area.

##### [Predominance with Arcade: Boise housing by year built](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2018/2d-viz/samples/3-predominance/)

This sample uses an Arcade expression to visualize the predominant decade housing units were built in the Boise, Idaho area.

##### [Multivariate visualization: 2016 U.S. presidential election](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2018/2d-viz/samples/2-multivariate/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a multivariate visualization using several variables related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The color indicates the winner (or predominant vote-getter). Opacity indicates the margin of victory. Size indicates the total number of votes cast in the county.

##### [Smart mapping for data exploration](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2018/2d-viz/samples/2-smart-mapping/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a data exploration app using the Smart Mapping APIs. You can use the slider widgets to modify the visualization based on variables related to the 2012 election.

##### [Clustering: 311 calls in NYC](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2018/2d-viz/samples/4-clustering/)

This sample demonstrates how to create an app for exploring 311 calls in New York City using Arcade expressions and point clustering.

##### [Relationship](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2018/2d-viz/samples/5-relationship/)

This sample demonstrates how to create a data exploration app using the Smart Mapping APIs. You can use the slider widgets to modify the visualization based on variables related to the 2012 election.

##### [Heatmap](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/visualization-heatmap/index.html)

This sample demonstrates how to create a heatmap visualization using live earthquake data.

##### [Scale-dependent heatmap](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/visualization-heatmap-scale/index.html)

This sample demonstrates how to create a scale-dependent heatmap, where the heatmap transitions to discrete points as you zoom to larger scales.

##### [Query statistics client-side by distance](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/featurelayerview-query-distance/index.html)

This sample demonstrates how to query for statistics in a FeatureLayerView by distance and display the results of the query in a series of charts.

This app displays homicide data from 50 U.S. cities between 2007 and 2017. The data was gathered and analyzed by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/unsolved-homicide-database/) and is [available for download here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides).
