### Summary

The ArcGIS JavaScript API lets you build applications where users can explore data interactively. The Smart Mapping module contains functions that allow you to generate renderers with smart default values for feature size, color, and opacity based on the distribution of the data and the basemap of your application. This module when used together with the slider widgets can help you create a simple app for exploring data from any feature layer with just a few lines of code. In this session we will walk through an application that uses the Smart Mapping modules and presents a simple application that users can use to uncover new understanding in your data.


### Demos

##### [Mexico Demographics](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/smart-mapping/demos/mexico-demographics/)

Demonstrates how to generate a continuous color renderer using the Smart Mapping API in the 4.3 version of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. This app also shows how to plug in a color slider to a layer's renderer so you can dynamically change the renderer when the slider handles are moved.

##### [Seattle Demographics](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/smart-mapping/demos/seattle-demographics/)

This sample similarly demonstrates how to work with Smart Mapping in a custom web app built on the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. The main difference is that this app was built with the 3.20 API, which has more functionality than the 4.3 Smart Mapping API as of the time this presentation was given.
