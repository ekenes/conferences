### Summary

This session delves into the JavaScript API’s GeometryEngine and demonstrates a few of the powerful UX capabilities it can bring to web applications. We’ll review how GeometryEngine can be used to customize editing applications, providing instant feedback to the user. It allows you to control a user’s editing operations before they push final edits to the server. Also, come to learn about how the measurement and overlay methods of GeometryEngine can be used to enhance your apps. This session will inspire you to explore other GeometryEngine methods and create complex apps with capabilities that would otherwise not be possible without client-side geometry operations.
