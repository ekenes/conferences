### Summary

Learn how to build 3D interactive web applications using the 4.0 version of the ArCGIS API for JavaScript and ArCGIS Online/Portal for ArcGIS webscenes. Using webscenes in your applications minimizes the amount of code needed to build interactive web applications. The webscene author creates the scene, adds layers, configures an attractive popup and styles the scene to bring the data to life. Once the webscene is ready the developer can use it to quickly build attractive interactive apps.


### Demos

##### [3D buildings](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-apps-guide/demos/3d-buildings/)

This app demonstrates how to load a web scene with the ArcGIS Portal API and modify its properties. You can leverage the slides API to apply layers, basemaps, and view properties to the view instance referencing the scene. You can also manipulate the filter and visualization of operational layers.

##### [Basic scene](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-apps-guide/demos/basics/)

This sample demonstrates how to construct a simple 3D app using the SceneView.
