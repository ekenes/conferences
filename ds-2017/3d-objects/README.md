### Summary

Build a 3D web application from the ground up starting with finding 3D data to consuming it in a custom web app. In this session we will cover the basics of finding and creating 3D data in ArcGIS Pro and publishing it to ArcGIS Online. We'll show how to programmatically create 3D web apps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and how the WebScene API can significantly ease the development experience. Using configured webscenes as the basis of  your applications minimizes the amount of code needed to build interactive web apps. The webscene author creates the scene, adds layers, configures an attractive popup and styles the scene to bring the data to life. Once the webscene is ready the developer can use it to quickly build attractive interactive apps.

### Demos

##### [Read a Scene layer](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-objects/demos/scene-layer/)

This app demonstrates how to load a SceneLayer to a custom JS app from a portal item. Once loaded, a scene layer's properties can be accessed and modified. This sample shows how to modify a layer's renderer after it has been loaded from the portal.

The data represent one million buildings in New York City. A ClassBreaksRenderer is set on the layer to show the age of the building. An opacity visual variable is also used to visualize building height relative to other buildings.
