### Summary

The ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript provides a set of APIs allowing you to build powerful interactive 3D mapping applications. In this session, we'll focus on the visualization capabilties specific to 3D views. We'll dive into the various symbol types and visual variables and demonstrate how they interact with renderers. You'll learn catographic techniques unique to 3D and other workflows similar to 2D visualizations techniques. This session will contain several demos showing how to thematically visualize 2D features with 3D symbols. We'll also provide an overview of how to visualize data in layers specific to 3D views.
