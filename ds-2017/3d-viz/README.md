### Summary

The ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript provides a set of APIs allowing you to build powerful interactive 3D mapping applications. In this session, we'll focus on the visualization capabilties specific to 3D views. We'll dive into the various symbol types and visual variables and demonstrate how they interact with renderers. You'll learn catographic techniques unique to 3D and other workflows similar to 2D visualizations techniques. This session will contain several demos showing how to thematically visualize 2D features with 3D symbols. We'll also provide an overview of how to visualize data in layers specific to 3D views.

### Demos

#####  [Draped vs. Billboarded icons](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-viz/demos/billboard-draped-elevation-comparison/)

Demonstrates the visual difference between draped and billboarded icons when located in areas of varying elevation.

##### [Draped vs. Billboarded icons (flat)](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-viz/demos/icons-billboard-draped-comparison/)

Demonstrates the visual difference between draped and billboarded icons when located in areas with little or no elevation.

#####  [2D vs. 3D buildings](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-viz/demos/buildings-comparison/)

Demonstrates the difference between representing buildings with 2D polygons vs. 3D extrusions.

##### [Obect symbol primitives](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-viz/demos/object-symbols/)

Allows the user to select various primitives when working with 3D symbols representing points.

##### [2D size (icons) vs. 3D extrusions](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-viz/demos/size-comparison/)

Demonstrates the difference between a 2D thematic visualization and a 3D thematic extrusion.

##### [3D smart mapping demo](http://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2017/3d-viz/demos/3d-smartmapping/)

Demonstrates the Smart mapping API in a 3D scene view using data representing world population.
