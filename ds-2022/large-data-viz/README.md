# ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Visualizing Large Datasets

length: 60 min

presenters: Kristian Ekenes, Anne Fitz

March 10, 2022 4:00 p.m. â€” 5:00 p.m. PST

Smoketree A-E | Palm Springs Convention Center

## Summary

Large, dense datasets are difficult to visualize well. These datasets typically involve overlapping features, which makes it difficult or even impossible to see spatial patterns in raw data. This session demonstrates several effective ways for visualizing large datasets. You will learn client-side techniques for visualizing density and clusters, as well as server-side preprocessing and aggregation.

## Demos

### [Filter features by attributes](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2022/large-data/demos/thailand-pipes/attributes.html)

This sample demonstrates how to filter features by attributes depending on the scale using a water pipes layer of Bangkok, Thailand containing more than 550,000 features. The approach involves filtering out pipes of a smaller diameter at small scales, and progressively displaying pipes with smaller diameters as the user zooms to large scales.

### [Filter features by view resolution](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2022/large-data/demos/thailand-pipes/length.html)

This sample demonstrates how to filter features by length depending on the view resolution using a water pipes layer of Bangkok, Thailand containing more than 550,000 features. The approach involves filtering out pipes shorter than the resolution of the view multiplied by a factor (e.g. lines shorter than 2 pixels, 3 pixels, etc.). This results in maps that look visually degraded, but is one approach for aggressively reducing your total download size.

### One Ocean

This session describes the process for preparing the data used in the One Ocean app. The data started from 52 million points (4 GB) and resulted in 85,000 points with hundreds of attributes (280 MB).
