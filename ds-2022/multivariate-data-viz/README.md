# ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Multivariate Data Visualization

length: 60 min

presenters: Kristian Ekenes, Jeremy Bartley

March 11, 2022 1:00 p.m. â€” 2:00 p.m. PST

Smoketree A-E | Palm Springs Convention Center

## Summary

Multivariate data visualization involves using two or more data variables in the same visualization. This allows you to view the relationship between two variables, contrast the differences between variables, and view spatial patterns that may otherwise not be obvious in single variable maps. In this session you will learn various multivariate styles available in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript so you can create immersive apps for exploring data.
