ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Key Highlights of the Last Year

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Key Highlights of the Last Year]()

HYBRID SESSION | Attend this session to get a tour of the most important advancements in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript that were introduced over the last year, and get inspired with new ideas for your web apps. You'll also get a taste for what other sessions will cover by seeing a sneak peek of select session demos, which will help you plan your DevSummit week.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Data Visualization](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2022/data-viz/)

Learn the basics of how to turn your raw data into information that tells a story with data-driven visualizations. This session will provide an overview to the various visualization techniques available in the API specific to vector data. You will also learn tips and tricks to help you feel more confident in making smart choices for visualizing your data.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Visualizing Change Over Time](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2022/change-over-time/)

In this session, you will learn several ways you can visualize change over time in web apps. This includes an overview of various widgets you can leverage that allow users to explore data. You will also learn about the rendering styles available in the API that are best suited for visualizing change in the same variable over time. Finally, we'll take a deep dive into learning how to create multi-dimensional animations of your data to view how data change at multiple intervals of time.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Visualizing Large Datasets](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2022/large-data-viz/)

Large, dense datasets are difficult to visualize well. These datasets typically involve overlapping features, which makes it difficult or even impossible to see spatial patterns in raw data. This session demonstrates several effective ways for visualizing large datasets. You will learn client-side techniques for visualizing density and clusters, as well as server-side preprocessing and aggregation.

## [ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Multivariate Data Visualization](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2022/multivariate-data-viz/)

Multivariate data visualization involves using two or more data variables in the same visualization. This allows you to view the relationship between two variables, contrast the differences between variables, and view spatial patterns that may otherwise not be obvious in single variable maps. In this session you will learn various multivariate styles available in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript so you can create immersive apps for exploring data.
