SmartMapping DemoTheater Notes
===============================

* Smart Mapping functions are available for generating on the fly visualizations with smart defaults. 

- Great for when you don't know your data very well. Not necessarily production apps when same data is used and doesn't change much (you'll already have a renderer saved to the layer).


* We have the Map Viewer in AGO. Why build a custom app? 

1. You know the type of data you're dealing with, but not the data itself.
	- You work with same field names frequently/across projects
	- You can bake in normalization without having to select it manually each time you change the field
	- You can filter data based on other attributes or geography
	- Apply to other layer with same attributes/schema but different features

2. You're familiar with the data, but it frequently changes.

3. You want to simplify to only fit your needs to create a simpler user experience.

4. Perhaps you want to add other functions...print, export renderer, etc.


Let's dive into the example.
