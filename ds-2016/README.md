Esri DevSummit 2016
===================

This repo contains the slides and demos used in my 2016 Esri Dev Summit talks on Smart Mapping and Geometry Engine. Note that the source in many of these samples will be updated as more functionality in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript is rolled out, but not in this repo since these samples are duplicates of those included in my [esri-js-samples](https://github.com/ekenes/esri-js-samples/) repo. The duplicates located here are only intended to reflect samples as they existed when I presented them at Dev Summit. 

Please see the [esri-js-samples](https://github.com/ekenes/esri-js-samples/) repo to review updated functionality based on API changes.
