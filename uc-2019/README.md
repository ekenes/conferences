# 2019 Dev Summit notes, slides, and demos

Navigate to the appropriate directory to view notes for the corresponding session described below.

## [2D Visualization with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2019/2d-viz)

The ArcGIS API for JavaScript lets you build powerful interactive mapping applications. Learn how you can turn your raw data into information that tells a story with simple 2D data-driven visualizations. This session will provide an overview to the various visualization techniques available in the API specific to 2D vector data.

## [3D Visualization with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2019/3d-viz)

The ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript provides a set of APIs allowing you to build powerful interactive 3D mapping applications. In this session, we'll focus on the visualization capabilities specific to 3D views. We'll dive into the various symbol types and visual variables and demonstrate how they interact with renderers. You'll learn cartographic techniques unique to 3D and see several demos showing how to thematically visualize 2D features with 3D symbols. We'll also provide an overview of how to visualize data in layers specific to 3D views.

## [Interactive Client-Side Web Mapping with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/uc-2019/interactive-apps)

Discover the client-side technologies baked into the JavaScript API to create powerful interactive applications. In this session you will learn about the different technologies that have been developed that allow you execute complex geometric operations on features without doing a round trip to a server. We will also showcase some examples like on-the-fly statistical analysis that could spark new ideas for original data interactions in your applications.
