### Summary

The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides the building blocks that allow you to build interactive data exploration applications.  These building blocks are the Smart Mapping modules, which contain functions that allow you to generate renderers with smart default values for size, color, and opacity based on the distribution of the data and the basemap of your application. When used together with the slider widgets, smart mapping can help you create a simple app for exploring data from any feature layer with just a few lines of code.   In this session we will walk through an application that uses the Smart Mapping modules and presents a simple application that users can use to gain more insight into the data.


### Demos

##### [Mexico Demographics](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2018/smart-mapping/demos/mexico-demographics/)

Demonstrates how to generate a continuous color renderer using the Smart Mapping API in the 4.6 version of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. This app also shows how to plug in a color slider to a layer's renderer so you can dynamically change the renderer when the slider handles are moved.

##### [Ecological Marine Units](https://ekenes.github.io/conferences/ds-2018/smart-mapping/demos/emu/)

Shows how using Smart Mapping's renderer creators can be powerful in visualizing data in a 3D view.
