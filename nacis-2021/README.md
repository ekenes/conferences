## Mapping change and progress with dynamic multivariate composite symbols

### Abstract

Composite vector symbols (also called multilayer symbols or multipart symbols) allow you to visualize multiple data variables in a single symbol. When designed well, composite symbols reveal nuances in datasets that may not otherwise be obvious in single-variate maps. However, they also increase the readerâ€™s cognitive load for understanding the visualization. This presentation will demonstrate the benefits and limitations of composite symbols with two unique examples. I will show how to visualize electoral swing for multiple parties within a single symbol using data from U.S. presidential elections (2000-2020), and demonstrate how to effectively represent overall progress in multi-phase projects using composite symbols in web maps.
